To compile: make

Usage: When started, the shell creates its own process group, to which its children will also belong unless they also create
their own groups. If the shell is killed via SIGTERM, it will rebroadcast it to its process group.  "exit" will also exit the shell,
and cause SIGTERM to be sent to any child processes running.  "status" is a shell builtin that will report the exit status of the
last child process to terminate.

SIGINT is ignored by the shell, and by any processes being run in the background.  Foreground processes may or may not ignore it
depending on their own default behavior; the shell does not modify it.  SIGTSTP (Ctrl-Z) will toggle the availability of background
mode: e.g., if Ctrl-Z is pressed, any attempt to run a process in the background will result in that process being run in the
foreground until Ctrl-Z is pressed again.

General syntax: cmd [args...] [> output file] [< input file] [&]

& if present must be the last argument to a command, and will cause the process invoked to spawn in the background unless 
background mode is disabled.  Input and output redirection can be done in either order.  (e.g., "> foo < bar" and "< bar > foo" are
both valid.)  There must be a space between the > or < and the filename.  Input redirection must be done after any arguments for the
command itself.
